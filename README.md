# sts2-cli

A CLI for Slay the Spire 2.

Runs the real game engine headless in your terminal — all damage, card effects, enemy AI, relics, and RNG are identical to the actual game. Everything is unlocked from the start: all characters, cards, relics, potions, and ascension levels — no timeline progression required.

## Setup

Requirements:
- [Slay the Spire 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2868840/Slay_the_Spire_2/) on Steam
- [.NET 9+ SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- Python 3.9+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wuhao21/sts2-cli.git
cd sts2-cli
./setup.sh      # copies DLLs from Steam → IL patches → builds
```

Or just run `python3 python/play.py` — it auto-detects and sets up on first run.

Tested with **v0.111.0 (Steam public-beta, build 24724944)**. After updating the
installed game in Steam, rerun `./setup.sh` to refresh the engine DLLs, patches,
and official English localization, then rebuild. Other game versions
may require adapter changes.

For a compatibility check, run `python3 python/play_full_run.py 5 Ironclad`
(repeat for Silent, Defect, Regent, and Necrobinder). A completed run reaches
victory or defeat; crashes, stalls, and timeouts return a nonzero exit code.

## Play

```bash
python3 python/play.py                        # interactive
python3 python/play.py --ascension 10         # Ascension 10
python3 python/play.py --character Silent      # play as Silent
```

Type `help` in-game:

```
  help     — show help
  map      — show map
  deck     — show deck
  potions  — show potions
  relics   — show relics
  quit     — quit

  Map:     enter path number (0, 1, 2)
  Combat:  card index / e (end turn) / p0 (use potion)
  Reward:  card index / s (skip)
  Rest:    option index
  Event:   option index / leave
  Shop:    c0 (card) / r0 (relic) / p0 (potion) / rm (remove) / leave
```

## JSON Protocol

For programmatic control (AI agents, RL, etc.), communicate via stdin/stdout JSON:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Sts2Headless/Sts2Headless.csproj
```

```json
{"cmd": "start_run", "character": "Ironclad", "seed": "test", "ascension": 0}
{"cmd": "action", "action": "play_card", "args": {"card_index": 0, "target_index": 0}}
{"cmd": "action", "action": "end_turn"}
{"cmd": "action", "action": "select_map_node", "args": {"col": 3, "row": 1}}
{"cmd": "action", "action": "skip_card_reward"}
{"cmd": "quit"}
```

Each command returns a JSON decision point (`map_select` / `combat_play` / `card_reward` / `rest_site` / `event_choice` / `shop` / `game_over`). All names are in English.

### RL / UI-faithful mode

Every decision includes `legal_actions`, a list of ready-to-send action bodies for action masking. Pass `"flow": "manual"` to `start_run` to get the game UI's screen transitions as explicit decisions. That adds a `rewards` screen (`claim_reward` / `proceed`), treasure chests (`open_chest` / `pick_relic` / `skip_relic`), Proceed after rest sites, events and shops, and the boss → next-act transition. `{"cmd": "get_state"}` re-reads the current decision.

```json
{"cmd": "start_run", "character": "Ironclad", "seed": "test", "flow": "manual"}
{"cmd": "action", "action": "claim_reward", "args": {"reward_index": 0}}
{"cmd": "action", "action": "proceed"}
```

A run has three acts, as in single player. Act 1 is Overgrowth or Underdocks, rolled from the seed the way the game's lobby does; pass `"act1": "overgrowth"` or `"act1": "underdocks"` to pin it. Act 2 is the Hive and act 3 is Glory. `context.act_id` names the current act.

`python/sts2_env.py` wraps this in a Gym-style `reset()` / `step()` API. See [docs/transitions.md](docs/transitions.md) for the full state machine.

## Game Logs

Every run is automatically logged to `logs/` as a JSONL file (one JSON per line), recording each game state and action with timestamps. Logs older than 7 days are cleaned up automatically.

```bash
python3 python/play.py --no-log    # disable logging
```

**When filing a bug report, please attach the relevant log file from `logs/`** — it contains the full step-by-step game state needed to reproduce the issue.
